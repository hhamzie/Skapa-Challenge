Story: as a technically savvy but lazy NYT spelling bee aficionado, I want to get all of the possible words that solve the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle.
Acceptance Criteria
1. I can call a RESTful API to get back JSON with a list of all words that meet the spelling bee criteria.
a. Word must be 4 letters or more
b. Word must contain the required letter
c. Word can be made from the required letter and any of the 6 optional letters
2. I can send 1 required letter and 6 optional letters to the API
a. The letters must be unique:
i. Required: a
ii. Optional:PNGRMS
3. Results are ordered alphabetically
4. Results do not contain duplicate words
Technical Details

2. Unit tests are required
3. You are encouraged to use packages and libraries that make your life easier unless
there is a package that solves the problem for you. (We are not aware of one...)
